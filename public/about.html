<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Fernando Iván Luna Quiñones, and I’m a passionate professional with a background in Industrial Engineering and a master’s degree focused on Quality and Productivity. I currently work at Ternium in a commercial role, but my real passion lies in data analytics, digital transformation, and project management.</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I’ve earned multiple certifications, including the Google Project Management Certificate and Lean Six Sigma Green Belt, and I’m currently pursuing my Black Belt certification with a joint program between Tecnológico de Monterrey and the University of Arizona. These experiences have allowed me to develop strong skills in process improvement, data analysis, and cross-functional collaboration.</p>

<p>I’m known for being detail-oriented, fast at executing tasks, and always open to learning. I’ve received feedback highlighting my speed and motivation, and I’m currently working on improving interdepartmental communication and accuracy. My goal is to transition into roles such as IT Project Engineer or Data Analyst in international companies that value innovation, work-life balance, and continuous improvement.</p>
